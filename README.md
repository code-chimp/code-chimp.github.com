# Repository Front Page

The [Jekyll][1] powered front page to my [Github][2] repository. Just for fun I
threw in a [Cake][5] buildfile to use during development.

# Features

* [HTML5 &#x2605; BoilerPlate][4] - crowd-sourced best practices from some of the best in the industry
* [Sass][4] - SCSS syntax (just my personal preference)
* [Jekyll][2] - Ruby static site generator
