    Theme Name: Boilerplate
    Theme URI: http://aarontgrogg.com/boilerplate/
    Description: A merger created by Aaron T. Grogg (<a href="http://aarontgrogg.com/">http://aarontgrogg.com/</a>) of the HTML5 Boilerplate (<a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">http://html5boilerplate.com/</a>) and the Starkers theme (<a href="http://starkerstheme.com/">http://starkerstheme.com/</a>), Boilerplate: Starkers provides developers with an ideal, bleeding-edge, clean-start theme.  Mark-up is minimal (thanks Elliott) and the most edge-case web technology is baked right in (thanks Paul, Divya and a large cast of supporting characters)!  Boilerplate themes are designed to serve as a Parent theme to whatever Child (<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes</a>) you care to add, but you could just as easily use this as a starting point and alter the PHP as your design needs.  More about this theme can be found at <a href="http://aarontgrogg.com/boilerplate/">http://aarontgrogg.com/boilerplate/</a>.
