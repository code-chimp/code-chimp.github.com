## A Sales Weasel, a Design Hippie, and a lowly Code Monkey walk into a pub&#133;

So chatting with a few friends I happened to discover that we have all been
noticing a consistent buzz around a cabal of neo-druidic beings self-identifying
as [the lean startup movement][0]. Opting to blindly spelunk the rabbit hole I
grabbed myself a copy of their grand grimoire ["The Lean Startup"][1] and
proceeded to plum the depths of the most sacred of business mysteries. Far
[more][10] [learned][11] [acoloytes][12] than I have already trod this path &#151;
should you find yourself so enchanted by their writings I suggest that you
procure your own copy.

Questionable hyperbole aside, after reading [the book][1] I had to the general
idea to create myself a quick 'n dirty template that could be utilized to
jumpstart [MVP][2] prototypes for all of the gajillion-dollar concepts pouring
forth from our fevered brains. As the crew's designated code monkey the choice
of technology stack is wholly mine so I decided to have some fun with the
selection. My unintended man-crush on the [CoffeeScript][6] language landed me
smack dab in the middle of the [NodeJS][7] universe, of which the most
promising <span title="Minshara - yeah I'm that much of a dork">Class M</span>
planet seemed to be [express][8]. The decision to use [Backbone.JS][4] for the
front end logic was entirely subjective &#150; to wit a plethora of gentlefolk
on [Proggit][9] had most regally dubbed it "hella-cool". As of this writing I
am still fleshing out my first "real-world" [MVP][2], so I am still fleshing out
this template with everything new I discover along the way.

Feel free to adapt the following project towards your own goals of world
domination, or point at it and laugh derisively &#151; whatever best fits your
own particular development idiom.
