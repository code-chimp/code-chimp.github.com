I have finally chiseled out enough time to retool this site and start documenting
all of the random personal projects I find myself playing with. Yippie me!

I have recently taken quite a shine to [Jeremy Ashkenas'][1] [CoffeeScript][2]
language and have taken to writing my project buildfiles in [Cake][3] in lieu of
[Ant][4] or other equally powerful build systems. This is not meant to indicate I
think [Cake][3] is necessarily better or 'more correct' than any other build
system - merely it's just one that I find fun to use while I am still getting the
hang of [NodeJS][5] and [CoffeeScript][2].
