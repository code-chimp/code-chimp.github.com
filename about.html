                        Hello, my name is Tim Goshinski and I live in Omaha, Nebraska with my lovely wife and amazing
                        daughter. My days are spent developing web applications primarily in .NET and SQL Server, but
                        long after my family has gone to bed I generally start tinkering on my Linux box, or one of my
                        Windows machines &#8230; in a Linux VirtualBox. I have fun seeing what trouble I can get myself into
                        with the new tech du jour currently generating buzz over at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming">Proggit</a>.
                        Sometimes I chase stuff like <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> or <a href="http://jquery.com">
                        jQuery</a> for immediate benefit in my chosen profession &#8212; other times I try to broaden
                        my horizons by playing with languages like <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/">F#</a>,
                        <a href="http://racket-lang.org">Racket</a>, or <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>
                        just for the fun of it.
                    </p>

                        Code-chimp is my space to document personal projects that grab my interest.  I write the posts
                        mostly in a tutorial or &#34;walk-through&#34; format primarily so that months later I can remember what
                        I&#39;ve done, and if anyone else is interested maybe they can follow along as well.  Since little of
                        what I do is truly original I will endeavor to cite references to the original source material
                        where appropriate.
